Hello, Chason Chaffin here. This is my personal blog, living at chason.codes for now even though its had
many addresses over the years. Currently I am using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to create the site.

I am a software developer working in Tokyo, Japan right now. Previously I've worked in Los Angeles,
California, USA and Houston, Texas, USA.

You can contact me at chason (at) chason.codes if you would like. I'll leave you with a favorite quote
of mine from [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris):

> A man at work, making something which he feels will exist because he is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of his mind and soul as well as of his body. Memory and imagination help him as he works.

Thanks for reading!
